## Project setup

### Nodejs

You will need to have the lts version of nodejs installed. You can get it either by [downloading it from here](https://nodejs.org), using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) for Linux and macOS.
To install nvm, you can follow the [nvm install script tutorial](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#install-script).

When you have nvm installed, run the following command:

```zsh
nvm install --lts
nvm use
```

In subsequent sessions, run `nvm use` to switch to node lts.

Follow the [official documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/nodejs/setup-on-windows) on a windows operating system.
